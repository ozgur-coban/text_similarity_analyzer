"Informed Consent Form for Extraction Based Fixed Orthodontic Treatment {{clinic_name}} {{form_name}} {{form_language}} GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ORTHODONTIC TREATMENTS A successful Orthodontic treatment is possible with the\n              patient/patient\\'s family being informed about the treatment to be\n              performed. However, every orthodontic treatment has its\n              limitations and potential risks. Please read the following\n              information. You are free to accept or reject orthodontic\n              treatment based on this information. If you have any questions or\n              if there is something you don\\'t understand, please consult your\n              doctor. Orthodontic Treatment is a long-term and discipline-requiring\n                process. A successful outcome requires collaboration between the\n                patient, the doctor, and the family. X-rays of the teeth and head are necessary for diagnostic\n                purposes at the beginning of the treatment, during the\n                treatment, and for control purposes after the treatment. Taking\n                photographs inside and outside the mouth before and during the\n                treatment is also necessary for a clearer monitoring of the\n                treatment. Advanced examinations may be required for the\n                diagnosis and treatment of certain orthodontic anomalies. These records may be used in scientific publications and\n                presentations without revealing your identity or in a way that\n                your identity will not be understood. These records will not be\n                used for purposes other than these, and they will not be shared\n                with others except at the request of legal authorities. The patient must adhere to the treatment prescribed by the\n                doctor until the end and in full. In case of lack of\n                collaboration from the patient/family leading to a lack of\n                adaptation, and if this situation persists, the doctor has the\n                right to terminate the treatment when it is determined that the\n                patient will not benefit from the treatment. The individual response of the patient's tissues to the\n                treatment is an important factor in the outcome of Orthodontic\n                Treatment. Especially in individuals in the developmental age\n                with \\\"skeletal anomalies,\\\" if the necessary growth support\n                cannot be provided, the targeted structure may not be achieved.\n                In such cases, the doctor may end the treatment to avoid harm to\n                the individual. The presence of any systemic disease related to the general\n                health status of the patient (blood diseases, bone diseases,\n                hormonal disorders, allergic diseases, etc.) may affect\n                orthodontic treatment. The patient must inform the orthodontist\n                about these and similar diseases before starting orthodontic\n                treatment and report any changes in health status/treatment\n                during the treatment. Depending on the type of treatment applied to correct dental,\n                jaw, and facial disorders within biological limits, it is\n                necessary to come to control appointments at intervals\n                determined by your doctor. Orthodontic treatment is not just about aligning teeth for\n                aesthetic purposes. The main goal is to achieve a healthy oral,\n                dental, and jaw structure that looks good, in addition to\n                providing good chewing function. Orthodontic treatment is applied to healthy teeth. Before\n                starting the treatment, all teeth should be examined by a\n                dentist, decayed teeth should be treated, root canal treatment\n                should be performed if necessary, and tooth brushing training\n                should be given. Treatment is not started for patients who do\n                not brush their teeth enough. Orthodontic treatment begins after\n                the patient's oral care improves, and the necessary treatments\n                are done. Orthodontic treatment consists of two consecutive stages: active\n                treatment and retention treatment. Active treatment corrects the\n                dental and jaw disorders, while retention treatment ensures the\n                permanence of the improvement achieved. The treatment fees\n                provided to you cover both stages. The durations of these stages\n                may vary depending on the severity of the disorder in each\n                individual. Even if the treatment is planned and carried out in accordance\n                with all rules, the guarantee of achieving all results cannot be\n                assured. This is because the limits of the selected treatment,\n                disruptions in the patient-doctor-family collaboration, and\n                patient-specific factors (such as: genetic structure, growth and\n                development factors that cannot be foreseen during treatment,\n                the response of oral and dental tissues to orthodontic\n                treatment, bad habits such as tooth clenching, teeth grinding,\n                etc.) make it impossible to guarantee results. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS DURING FIXED ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT During orthodontic treatment, various treatment stages and\n              materials are used. Brackets are attached to the teeth and wires\n              are threaded through them. Supportive screws placed in the jawbone\n              when necessary; jaw-expanding screw devices, metal springs,\n              elastic chains, etc., can also be used. Sometimes, external\n              devices that need to be worn and removed by the patient (such as\n              headgear/face masks) or intraoral/extraoral rubber bands may be\n              necessary. Instructions and recommendations from your doctor\n              regarding their use must be followed exactly. Temporary sensitivity in the teeth, small wounds in the gums,\n              lips, cheeks, or tongue may develop during orthodontic treatments.\n              Eating hard foods like nuts, chewing gum, and sticky substances\n              can cause damage to the appliance. Avoiding such foods is crucial\n              for the progress of your treatment. Inform your doctor immediately\n              in such situations and always follow your doctor's\n              recommendations. Please read the brochure we provide carefully, as\n              it will assist us in this matter, and we appreciate your\n              cooperation. Failure to brush the teeth adequately during treatment can lead\n              to cavities, inflammation of the gums, gum recession, and loss of\n              supporting bone. Additionally, the consumption of acidic beverages\n              can cause permanent matte white spots, which increase with the use\n              of braces. Therefore, it is essential to brush your teeth\n              regularly after main and intermediate meals. For optimal oral care\n              and healthy teeth and gums, regular dental check-ups are\n              necessary. In some cases, even with good care, gum recession may\n              occur due to very thin supporting bone tissue around the\n              teeth. Variations in the shape, size, and position of the teeth, small\n              or missing teeth, or abnormally positioned teeth may prevent\n              achieving the ideal treatment result (e.g., completely closing\n              extraction spaces). Sometimes, gaps may be visible between\n              corrected teeth near the gum line. Supportive treatments such as\n              aesthetic fillings, crown-bridge restorations, or periodontal\n              treatment may be required for these cases. Shortening of the roots of some teeth may occur during\n              orthodontic treatment. Generally, the amount of shortening is\n              minimal and does not have a significant impact. If severe\n              shortening is detected, the doctor may decide to terminate\n              orthodontic treatment. Some patients with sensitive constitutions may experience\n              allergic reactions to materials used in orthodontic treatment. In\n              such a case, you must inform our clinic as soon as possible. In\n              this situation, a change in the treatment plan or discontinuation\n              of treatment may be necessary. Immediately after completing active orthodontic treatment, there\n              is a tendency for teeth to change their positions and return to\n              their initial positions. Therefore, 'retention treatment' should\n              be started right after active orthodontic treatment ends. In this\n              treatment, either a wire is permanently attached to the inside of\n              the teeth or a removable retention device is used. Fixed retention\n              devices remain behind the teeth indefinitely unless otherwise\n              stated by your doctor. It is crucial to use removable retention\n              devices as instructed by the doctor to ensure the permanence of\n              the treatment result. Failure to follow the doctor's advice when\n              using removable retention devices inevitably leads to the teeth\n              returning to their previous state. The disruption of teeth and\n              relationships due to incomplete retention treatment may require a\n              new orthodontic treatment. This situation requires additional\n              fees. In the following periods after the completion of orthodontic\n              treatment, the closure of teeth may be negatively affected in\n              various situations. Examples include genetic influences that\n              determine the size of teeth, jaws, and tongue, growth or\n              developmental changes, continued oral habits such as mouth\n              breathing, tongue thrust, finger sucking, and inappropriate\n              pressures exerted by erupted wisdom teeth. These are situations\n              that can develop beyond the control of the orthodontist and may\n              require additional treatments. Surgical Treatment: In cases such as the extraction of wisdom\n              teeth at the age of 20, extraction of teeth for orthodontic\n              purposes, treatment of soft tissue anomalies, and exposure of\n              impacted teeth, collaboration is done with oral, dental, and\n              maxillofacial surgeons. Orthognathic Surgery: In adults with jaw anomalies, orthodontic\n              treatment alone may not be sufficient. Plastic surgeons may need\n              to work together and plan in cases of closure problems involving\n              jaw bones. Orthognathic surgery (surgery performed on the jaws)\n              involves interventions to bring teeth, jaw bones, and other soft\n              and hard tissues into the best anatomical position. During the\n              preoperative preparation period, attempts are made to align the\n              teeth in the upper and lower jaws before jaw surgery. However,\n              this cannot be fully achieved before surgery because correct tooth\n              relationships cannot be achieved unless the jaws are in their\n              proper positions. In this case, orthodontic treatment continues\n              for some time after the operation. In such treatments, the physician performing the surgical\n              procedure is responsible for explaining the risks and possible\n              undesired situations related to the surgery and obtaining consent.\n              The Orthodontist is only responsible for the orthodontic treatment\n              part of this treatment. No guarantee or absolute success can be\n              assured with these treatments. Expected Outcomes of Orthognathic Treatment: Correction of dental\n              misalignment, correction of inter-jaw disharmony, restoration of\n              healthy chewing function, achievement of dental aesthetics,\n              improvement of facial aesthetics. If Recommended Treatment Is Not Applied: Healthy chewing cannot\n              be performed, joint problems may arise, dental misalignment may\n              not be corrected, unwanted movements and habits may develop.\n              Patients may experience some difficulties during orthodontic\n              treatment. To avoid experiencing these difficulties and/or to\n              easily overcome them, the rules explained to you must be strictly\n              followed.

POTENTIAL NEGATIVES DURING ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT Negative situations may arise during orthodontic treatment. a. Orthodontic forces applied to teeth may cause painful tooth\n                sensitivity for about a week. b. Metal, porcelain, or acrylic brackets on teeth may temporarily\n                create difficulties in eating, speaking, and swallowing. c. Ulcers may occur on the lips, cheeks, and tongue. d. Oral hygiene may become challenging. e. Undesirable situations like bracket detachment or wire breakage\n                may occur. f. Frequent bracket detachment can cause damage to both the\n                treatment and the enamel layer of the tooth. g. Erosion (resorption) may occur at the root tips. h. Damage to the tooth nerve may result in the need for root canal\n                treatment. i. If the supporting bone tissue around the tooth is very thin,\n                gum recession due to bone loss may be observed. Insufficient brushing of teeth during treatment may lead to\n              decay, permanent white spots, and gum inflammation. Gum\n              inflammation over time leads to red color changes, bleeding, and\n              gum enlargement. Therefore, teeth should be brushed regularly\n              after main and snack meals until it is ensured that all food\n              residues are removed. To prevent damage or breakage of fixed braces attached to teeth,\n              it is necessary to adhere to the prohibition list provided by your\n              orthodontist until the end of the treatment.
