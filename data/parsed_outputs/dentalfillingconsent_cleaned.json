"Informed Consent Form for Extraction Based Fixed Orthodontic Treatment {{clinic_name}} {{form_name}} {{form_language}} Dental Filling Consent The purpose of this form is to inform you about health-related\n              issues and enable your participation in the decisions to be made.\n              Except for legal and medical obligations, you can refuse to be\n              informed. This form, although designed to meet the needs of most patients\n              in many conditions, should not be considered a document that\n              covers all treatment risks. Depending on your personal health\n              condition, your doctor may provide different or additional\n              information. The decision to accept or decline the procedures after learning\n              the benefits and possible risks of diagnosis, medical treatment,\n              and surgical interventions is up to you. Things You Should Know Due to individual differences in healing potentials, it is not\n                possible to predict an individualâ€™s recovery potential before\n                the procedures. The treatment applied to you may fail in some\n                cases, require repetition, and its outcome cannot be guaranteed. Your consumption of cigarettes, alcohol, and sugar, as well as\n                your tooth brushing frequency, can limit the success of the\n                performed procedures. You should provide your doctor with detailed information about\n                your known physical and mental health. You should also inform\n                your doctor about any allergic reactions to drugs, food,\n                anesthetic materials, pollen, or dust; systemic diseases; skin\n                and gum reactions; abnormal bleeding tendencies, and other\n                conditions related to your general health. Targeted Process: {{other_keys_targeted_process}} What Happens if the Procedure Is Not Performed? If you do not accept the recommended treatments and\n              interventions, the decay lesion may progress, causing irreversible\n              extensive material loss, pain, and sensitivity, infection, bad\n              breath, color and aesthetic defects, and even tooth loss which\n              could cause issues with chewing and jaw joint functions. Risks Associated with the Procedure During Treatment Minor pain may occur in treatments that do not require anesthesia. In some types of anesthesia, adequate numbness may not be\n              achieved, and additional anesthesia may be required. Temporary swelling, redness, bruising, and numbness in the cheek\n              may rarely occur due to anesthesia. Medications used can leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth and\n              may cause nausea. Metal bands and wooden wedges used during filling can traumatize\n              the tooth and cause sensitivity. Small materials used during treatment may be swallowed without the\n              control of the dentist. Injuries in soft tissues may occur due to involuntary movements of\n              the patient during the treatment. If the decay progresses in the tooth where filling treatment has\n              started, root canal treatment may be needed. During root canal treatment, the canal tool may break and remain\n              inside the tooth. Root canal filling material may be insufficient or may protrude\n              from the root tip due to uncontrollable factors during the filling\n              process. Extraction of the tooth may be necessary due to blocked canals,\n              excessive material loss, root cracks and fractures, etc., in teeth\n              where root canal treatment has started. Prosthetic procedures may be needed during treatment, and in cases\n              of severe destruction, extraction of the tooth may be required. During the application of a post as an alternative treatment in\n              cases of severe destruction of tooth tissue, the old root canal\n              treatment may not be completely removable, and an appropriate\n              space for the post may not be preparable; cracks may occur in the\n              root of the tooth due to the force applied during the placement of\n              the post. When the existing crown is removed for treatment of the tooth\n              underneath, the extraction of the related tooth may be necessary\n              due to severe decay or material loss in the underlying tooth. During the removal of a crown or bridge, the crown or tooth may\n              break. Therefore, the extraction of the involved tooth or remaking\n              of the crown may be necessary. Risks Associated with the Procedure After the treatment Complications such as pain and sensitivity may occur after the\n              filling. Persistent pain may require root canal treatment.\n              Temporary pains may last 2-3 days, and cold sensitivity may\n              persist for 3-4 weeks. Pain during chewing can occur for 7-10 days after root canal\n              treatment, may last longer in persistent infection situations, and\n              may even require repeat root canal treatment. Swelling on the face may rarely occur after root canal treatment. In cases where an old root canal treatment needs to be redone, the\n              old canal filling may not be completely removable, and an ideal\n              filling may not be achievable to the root tip, resulting in\n              unsuccessful root canal treatment. Pain may occur in the jaw joints, the area of anesthesia, and the\n              gums for several days after treatment. Temporary sores may develop in the gums or other tissues inside\n              the mouth. The filling made in cases where there is excessive loss of tooth\n              tissue that can bond may fall out. In cases of severe destruction of tooth tissue, the post applied\n              as an alternative treatment may not adhere sufficiently and may\n              come out. Sensitivity may occur for a while in teeth treated with caps and\n              porcelain fillings if no root canal treatment is present. Caps and porcelain fillings made on treated teeth may fall out or\n              break. Sensitivity may occur after whitening treatments in treated\n              patients. Accidental contact of the whitening agent with surrounding tissues\n              may cause temporary whitening of the touched area. Since each patient's tooth color is different and the aesthetic\n              fillings we use do not carry the exact same characteristics as\n              tooth tissue, the desired tooth color may not be completely\n              achieved, and there may be a slight tone difference. The tooth color that is satisfactory immediately after aesthetic\n              fillings may change over time. The filling may need to be redone\n              after a few years Fillings made on front teeth and back group teeth after biting and\n              tearing functions may cause the filling to fall out or break due\n              to the forces applied to the front teeth. In patients with advanced joint problems, the jaw joint may\n              dislocate due to prolonged mouth opening after treatment. {{other_keys_target_treatment_teeth}} I accept the treatment to be performed on it.
