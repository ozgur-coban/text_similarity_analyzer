"EMBEDDED TOOTH EXTRACTION INFORMATION AND CONSENT FORM {{clinic_name}} {{form_name}} {{form_language}} Hasta Bilgileri Full Name: {{patient_info_name}} {{patient_info_surname}} Date of Birth: {{patient_info_birth_date}} GENERAL INFORMATION: The purpose of this form is to raise awareness about your health\n              issues and to ensure your participation in the decision to be\n              taken. You can refuse to inform, except in cases of legal and\n              medical necessity. Although this form has been defined to meet the needs of most\n              patients in many conditions, it should not be considered a\n              document that includes the risks of all treatment modalities.\n              Depending on your personal health situation, your doctor may give\n              you different or additional information. After learning the benefits and possible risks of diagnosis,\n              medical treatment and surgical interventions, it is up to you to\n              accept or not to accept the applications. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISEASE: Because there is a difference between individuals in terms of\n              healing potential, the healing potential of your gums and bones\n              cannot be predicted before the procedures. Since the impacted\n              tooth operation to be applied to you may fail in some cases, it\n              may need to be repeated and the result of the treatment cannot be\n              guaranteed. Our consumption of cigarettes, alcohol and sugar can affect your\n              gingival healing and limit the success of the procedures. If you\n              smoke, all responsibility belongs to you. You should provide detailed information to your physician about\n              your physical and mental health to the best of your knowledge. You\n              should also provide detailed information about previous allergic\n              reactions to drugs, food, anesthetics, pollen or dust; systemic\n              diseases; skin and gum reactions; abnormal bleeding tendency and\n              other conditions related to your general health. You should inform\n              your doctor. DESCRIPTION AND APPLICATION OF THE PROCEDURE/TREATMENT: During the procedure, after local/general anesthetic agents are\n              applied to you and adequate anesthesia is provided, the surgical\n              procedure will begin. Bone tissue removal can be performed until\n              the impacted tooth is reached, and you may feel a vibration-like\n              feeling during this process. This is a normal situation. Then your\n              impacted tooth will be extracted and then curettage will be\n              applied to the residual tissues. Following these procedures,\n              sutures that can dissolve or not dissolve on their own and the\n              wound to be buffered with a sterile tampon are applied. EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE PROCEDURE/TREATMENT: After the procedure, it is expected that the symptoms such as\n              pain, swelling, infection caused by impacted teeth will disappear\n              and will not occur again. It is also aimed to prevent the\n              occurrence of possible conditions that may cause cysts, tumors,\n              jaw joint problems, muscle problems, etc. that may be encountered\n              in the future. IMPORTANT PROPERTIES OF DRUGS TO BE USED DURING THE\n          PROCEDURE/TREATMENT Local anesthesia will be applied so that you do not feel what is\n              done during the surgical procedure to be applied to the patients.\n              These applications are scientifically and ethically accepted\n              applications all over the world. The following are the problems\n              that may arise during and after local, regional or infiltrative\n              anesthesia applications; ● Drop in blood pressure and pulse:There may be fluctuations in\n              pulse and blood pressure during or after the procedure. This may\n              even lead to loss of consciousness and fainting. ● Pain:You may feel pain related to anesthesia in the area during\n              and after anesthesia. Also, a headache may appear during and after\n              the procedure. ● Neural complications: After anesthesia, temporary or permanent\n              neural flares (total numbness, hypersensitivity) may occur in rare\n              cases. ● Nausea and vomiting:It may occur during or after the procedure.\n              In such cases, necessary intervention can be made by the physician\n              and the relevant healthcare team. ● Infection:Each injection is made with one-time use injectors.\n              Apart from that, disinfection of the area provides infection\n              control that may occur after the procedure. ● Complications related to the muscles:After anesthesia,\n              limitation of movement due to muscle involvement related to the\n              application area, a decrease in mouth movements may be\n              observed. ● Following anesthesia applications:Anesthesia can be repeated\n              due to reasons such as anatomical differences that vary from\n              person to person, the length of the procedure applied, the\n              patient's low pain threshold and the fact that he/she feels pain\n              from the procedure. The number of applications is planned to the\n              extent that the systemic condition of the patient allows. ● Allergic reactions:Depending on the foreign reaction created by\n              the anesthetic solution in the person's body, mild reactions such\n              as skin rashes, redness and itching may occur, as well as serious\n              effects such as shortness of breath, decreased pulse, decreased\n              blood pressure, and cessation of breathing and heartbeat. These\n              are anaesthesia. It can be seen not applied, as well as may occur\n              hours after the procedure ● The harm that the patient can cause to himself: Since the\n              effect of anesthesia continues for a while after tooth extraction\n              or the end of the procedure, the patient may suffer self-biting\n              damage. ● With the sudden movement of the patient during anesthesia, the\n              local anesthetic needle may break or the anesthesia may be applied\n              to the wrong place. ● Especially during the extraction of posterior teeth, color\n              changes can be observed due to the narrowing of the vessels in\n              this area, which can last for several hours. 1. PROBLEMS THAT MAY OCCUR IF THE PROCEDURE/TREATMENT IS APPLIED\n          (COMPLICATION) The risks that may arise from the treatments to be applied or the\n              risks that may arise due to the surgical procedure, anesthesia or\n              recommended drugs during the procedures; ● Complications such as numbness, pain, swelling, infections,\n              discoloration and tenderness may occur in the lips, tongue, jaw,\n              cheeks and teeth. ● Differences in the gingival level may occur during and after\n              treatment, and accordingly, there may be changes in\n              appearance. ● In addition to these, delay in healing, damage to teeth,\n              allergies to recommended drugs and jaw joint problems may occur\n              after the procedures to be done. ● Additional or different applications such as tooth extraction,\n              root canal treatment, biomaterial application may be necessary\n              during or after the operation. ● During the extraction of teeth adjacent to the sinuses in the\n              upper jaw, bone fragments may escape into the sinuses or there may\n              be a relationship between the sinus cavity and the oral cavity.\n              Consultation from an Ear Nose and Throat specialist can be\n              requested if necessary. 2. PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE FACED IF THE 2nd PROCEDURE/TREATMENT IS NOT\n          APPLIED If you do not accept the recommended treatment and interventions,\n              gingivitis, bone loss, infection, tooth sensitivity or loosening,\n              tooth loss and related problems in chewing and jaw joint functions\n              may occur. 3. PROCEDURE / ALTERNATIVE TO THE TREATMENT It includes the procedures of not taking any action and following\n              up with regular checks. There is no alternative. 4. RISK OF DEATH OF THE PROCEDURE/TREATMENT Like other surgeries, jaw surgery carries certain risks. These\n              can be simple risks as well as fatal. It is very important that\n              you understand well some of the risks that may develop after lower\n              jaw fracture surgery. 5. MEDICAL ASSISTANCE RELATED TO THE SAME SUBJECT IF NEEDED In cases where the relevant physicians cannot be reached in the\n              Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department, help can be obtained\n              from the Emergency Medicine Units of the hospitals. 6. LIFESTYLE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE PATIENT'S\n          HEALTH After the operation, you should hold the tampon applied to your\n              mouth for 30 minutes by biting it to create pressure on the\n              operation area. The taste of blood and bleeding in the form of\n              leakage in your mouth for the first 48 hours after removing the\n              tampon is normal. Do not forget that even a drop of blood mixed\n              with saliva will feel more bleeding than normal. If you think that\n              the bleeding is increasing, you can put a clean gauze on the\n              operation area and apply pressure for 30 minutes. If you think\n              that there is excessive bleeding, you should definitely call your\n              doctor. ● Apply cold compress on the operation area for 10-15 minutes at\n              10-minute intervals from the outside for the first 24 hours.\n              Applying cold compresses for a long time without interruption will\n              be harmful on the contrary. ● You should not eat foods that require chewing movements before\n              the effect of anesthesia wears off. Otherwise, you may bite the\n              inside of your cheek and cause new injuries and related pain. If\n              possible, you should prefer soft foods. ● Strictly do not use hot foods, cigarettes or alcohol for the\n              first 48 hours after the operation. Do not prefer the operation\n              area while eating. You should avoid applications that require\n              effort such as sports. Otherwise, wound healing may be delayed and\n              the risk of complications may increase. ● By using 2-3 pillows for the first 2 days following the\n              operation, if you keep your head up in the sleeping position, you\n              will help keep the bleeding and swelling to a minimum. ● If the operation area has been stitched, do not irritate it\n              with foreign materials such as toothpicks. Do not delay the\n              appointment for the removal of stitches. ● To keep your oral hygiene at the highest level after the\n              operation, brush all your teeth except the operation area after\n              every meal and floss at least once a day. Do not use any mouthwash\n              for the first 24 hours. ● Two days after the operation, keep your toothbrush in warm\n              water for 2-3 minutes and start brushing your teeth in the\n              operation area. ● Avoid movements such as sucking, spitting and pipetting in\n              order not to disrupt the clot that occurs at the operation site\n              and is very important for healing. ● If there are drugs prescribed for you by your doctor, you\n              should use them without interruption for your health. If you see\n              any side effects, you should stop using the drug and call your\n              doctor immediately. Never use aspirin-derived drugs. ● It is normal to have bruising and swelling on your face after\n              the operation, especially for the first 3-4 days. If you think it\n              is excessive or your pain is increasing, you can consult your\n              doctor. ● After the operation, there may be numbness and extreme\n              sensitivity in the neighboring areas. Various treatments such as\n              root canal treatment and filling can be applied to the tooth\n              adjacent to your extracted tooth 7. ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE PROCEDURE/TREATMENT Surgical procedures can be performed in a time interval from a\n              few minutes to a few hours depending on factors such as the\n              position of the impacted tooth and patient compliance. Due to a\n              negativity occurring during the procedure, the procedure may be\n              postponed or it may be decided to continue under general\n              anesthesia. This process may not be on the same day, but may be in\n              the following days/weeks. The patient is informed about the\n              complications that may occur during this period and the patient is\n              followed up. Doctor's Explanation to the Patient: {{other_keys_doctor_advice}} *According to the Patient Rights Regulation, 1 copy of the form\n              will be given to you. Please inform when the form is not given to\n              you. CONSENT My doctor gave me the necessary explanations about my health. I got detailed information about what the planned\n                treatment/surgery is, its necessity, the course of the surgery\n                and other treatment options, their risks, the consequences that\n                may occur if I do not get treatment, the probability of success\n                and side effects of the treatment. I know that other doctor(s) other than the doctor who will\n                perform the surgery may also undergo the operation. Since my\n                surgery is at the University Training and Research Hospital, I\n                am aware that residency student (assistant) doctors will also be\n                involved in my surgery. If necessary, my procedure will be\n                performed by an assistant under the supervision of an\n                academician, surgeon or specialist with appropriate training and\n                expertise. I agree. I understood the points that I should pay attention to before\n                and after the treatment/surgery. Tobacco and Tobacco Products: I was told that smoking tobacco\n                and tobacco products (cigarettes, hookahs, cigars, pipes, etc.)\n                before or after my surgery may prolong my healing process and\n                cause cancer, cardiovascular diseases in a long time. If I use\n                any of these substances, I know that I am at greater risk of\n                encountering healing problems. It has been announced that all documents and samples taken\n                during the diagnosis/treatment/intervention can be used for\n                educational purposes. My doctor answered all my questions in a way I could understand. I learned about people who will perform treatment/surgery. I am sane and consider myself competent to decide. I want my\n                surgery done. I know that I don't have to give consent for the\n                treatment/surgery if I don't want it and/or I can stop the\n                procedure at any stage I want. Use of tissue: Any tissue that is not required for medical\n                diagnosis to treat my condition can be used for medical\n                research, provided that it has been examined by the ethics\n                committee and the research is approved within the framework of\n                ethical rules. I give my consent for the research results to be\n                published in the medical literature as long as the patient's\n                identity is kept. I can refuse to participate in such a study\n                and I am aware that this refusal will not adversely affect my\n                treatment in any way. I consent to the use of any tissue,\n                medical device or body part that may have been removed during\n                the surgical procedure. Medical research: I consent to the review of clinical\n                information from my medical records for the advancement of\n                medical work, medical research, and physician education, subject\n                to adherence to my institution's patient confidentiality\n                guidelines. I consent to the publication of the research results in the\n                medical literature as long as patient confidentiality is\n                protected. I am aware that I can refuse to participate in such a\n                study and that this refusal will not adversely affect my\n                treatment in any way. Photographs and Audiences: I consent to the photographing or\n                video recording of the surgery, including appropriate parts of\n                my body, for scientific, medical, or educational purposes,\n                provided that the images do not reveal my identity. At the same\n                time, I know that qualified staff may be available in the\n                operating room during the surgery to improve medical education. The procedures to be performed, duration, possible results and\n              complications, risks, and consequences if I do not accept the\n              treatment were explained in detail. I authorize the physician,\n              nurse and other healthcare professionals to carry out this\n              practice, which is deemed appropriate, of my own free will,\n              without any pressure or direction, and I demand that this practice\n              be done. I ALLOW this app to be made voluntarily. II. CONSENT My doctor explained all the complications and risks of the\n              procedure to me. My doctor answered all my questions regarding my medical\n              condition and the procedure. I understood all the information my doctor provided to me. Regarding the content of the oral consent form, I have read it,\n              understood it, and I accept it.
