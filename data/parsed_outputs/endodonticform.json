"Informed Consent Form for Extraction Based Fixed Orthodontic Treatment {{clinic_name}} {{form_name}} {{form_language}} Endodontic Treatment I agree that the following treatments will be applied I understand and consent that many factors contribute to the\n              success of root canal treatment and not all factors can be\n              determined in advance. Some of the factors are: my resistance to\n              infection; the bacteria causing the infection; the size, shape and\n              location of the canals. My case may be more difficult if my tooth\n              has blocked, curved, or narrow canals. I accept that antibiotics,\n              analgesics and other drugs can have allergic effects such as\n              redness, swelling of the tissue, itching, nausea and anaphylactic\n              shock (very rare). During the treatment, the treatment may change or new procedures\n              may be added to the treatment due to reasons that could not be\n              determined during the examination while working on the tooth. The\n              most common procedure is root canal treatment. I give permission\n              for all/any changes and additions necessary for my tooth. Although rare, the washing agents used during root canal\n              treatment may cause allergic reactions in some patients. I am\n              informed about this risk. I accept that there is no guarantee that root canal treatment\n              will save my tooth, complications may occur due to treatment, and\n              although rare, metal objects may be cemented into the root canal\n              and these may dislocate outside the root. I am aware that\n              additional surgical procedures may rarely need to be performed\n              following root canal treatment.
