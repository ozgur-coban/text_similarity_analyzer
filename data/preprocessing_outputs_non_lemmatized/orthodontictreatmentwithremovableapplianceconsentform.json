"Informed Consent Form for Extraction Based Fixed Orthodontic Treatment GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ORTHODONTIC TREATMENTS A successful Orthodontic treatment is possible with the patientpatients family being informed about the treatment to be performed. However, every orthodontic treatment has its limitations and potential risks. Please read the following information. You are free to accept or reject orthodontic treatment based on this information. If you have any questions or if there is something you dont understand, please consult your doctor. Orthodontic Treatment is a long-term and discipline-requiring process. A successful outcome requires collaboration between the patient, the doctor, and the family. X-rays of the teeth and head are necessary for diagnostic purposes at the beginning of the treatment, during the treatment, and for control purposes after the treatment. Taking photographs inside and outside the mouth before and during the treatment is also necessary for a clearer monitoring of the treatment. Advanced examinations may be required for the diagnosis and treatment of certain orthodontic anomalies. These records may be used in scientific publications and presentations without revealing your identity or in a way that your identity will not be understood. These records will not be used for purposes other than these, and they will not be shared with others except at the request of legal authorities. The patient must adhere to the treatment prescribed by the doctor until the end and in full. In case of lack of collaboration from the patientfamily leading to a lack of adaptation, and if this situation persists, the doctor has the right to terminate the treatment when it is determined that the patient will not benefit from the treatment. The individual response of the patients tissues to the treatment is an important factor in the outcome of Orthodontic Treatment. Especially in individuals in the developmental age with skeletal anomalies, if the necessary growth support cannot be provided, the targeted structure may not be achieved. In such cases, the doctor may end the treatment to avoid harm to the individual. The presence of any systemic disease related to the general health status of the patient blood diseases, bone diseases, hormonal disorders, allergic diseases, etc. may affect orthodontic treatment. The patient must inform the orthodontist about these and similar diseases before starting orthodontic treatment and report any changes in health statustreatment during the treatment. Depending on the type of treatment applied to correct dental, jaw, and facial disorders within biological limits, it is necessary to come to control appointments at intervals determined by your doctor. Orthodontic treatment is not just about aligning teeth for aesthetic purposes. The main goal is to achieve a healthy oral, dental, and jaw structure that looks good, in addition to providing good chewing function. Orthodontic treatment is applied to healthy teeth. Before starting the treatment, all teeth should be examined by a dentist, decayed teeth should be treated, root canal treatment should be performed if necessary, and tooth brushing training should be given. Treatment is not started for patients who do not brush their teeth enough. Orthodontic treatment begins after the patients oral care improves, and the necessary treatments are done. Orthodontic treatment consists of two consecutive stages: active treatment and retention treatment. Active treatment corrects the dental and jaw disorders, while retention treatment ensures the permanence of the improvement achieved. The treatment fees provided to you cover both stages. The durations of these stages may vary depending on the severity of the disorder in each individual. Even if the treatment is planned and carried out in accordance with all rules, the guarantee of achieving all results cannot be assured. This is because the limits of the selected treatment, disruptions in the patient-doctor-family collaboration, and patient-specific factors such as: genetic structure, growth and development factors that cannot be foreseen during treatment, the response of oral and dental tissues to orthodontic treatment, bad habits such as tooth clenching, teeth grinding, etc. make it impossible to guarantee results. There is a tendency for the teeth to change their position and return to their original position at the beginning of the treatment immediately after the end of orthodontic treatment. For this reason, reinforcement treatment should be started as soon as the active orthodontic treatment is finished. In this treatment, either a fixed wire is attached to the inner side of the teeth or a reinforcing device is used that the patient can put on and take off. Fixed reinforcement appliances stay behind the teeth indefinitely, unless your physician tells you otherwise. The use of the removable reinforcing device in accordance with the physiciansinstructions is very important for the permanence of the treatment result. It is inevitable for the teeth to return to their former state as a result of using the removable retaining appliances without following the physiciansadvice. This requires recharging. After the end of orthodontic treatment, the closure of the teeth may be adversely affected in various situations in the following periods. Examples of these conditions are genetic effects that determine the size of teeth, jaws and tongue, growth or developmental changes, mouth breathing, tongue thrusting, continuation of oral habits such as thumb sucking, inappropriate eruption pressures of wisdom teeth. These are conditions that can develop beyond the control of the orthodontist and may require additional treatments. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REMOVABLE ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT AND NEGATIVES THAT MAY EXPERIENCE Depending on the type of your removable appliance, it may be necessary to use it all day, at night, or to remove it during meals. Your doctor will explain to you the most appropriate form of use. When the elements of removable appliances are placed on your teeth, there may be pain in the first week and may affect your daily chewing functions. In addition, it is normal to have sensitivity and pain in your teeth as a result of the activation of the wires during appointments. In the case of a screwed appliance, the feeling of pressure that will occur in your teeth as a result of each turn of the screw is normal and will decrease and disappear within 1-2 days. Apart from this, in case of continuous and increasing pain or when you encounter a problem that stings, hits or hurts, contact your doctor by phone. Your speech may be impaired on the first day of wearing the appliance. This is a temporary period lasting at most 1 week. Reading something aloud and talking a lot during this time will shorten this process. In the first few days of wearing the appliance, it is normal to increase your saliva secretion and to spit out. Continue to use your appliance. If oral hygiene is not taken care of during the treatment and the teeth are not brushed regularly, discoloration, scars, and bruises may occur on the teeth. It is important for the health of your gums and soft tissues gingival, palate, lips. Soft tissue irritations and various infections can be observed if proper cleaning is not done. For this reason, after each meal, you should hold the acrylic part of the appliance with your teeth and brush it as recommended by your physician. However, when using these appliances, sometimes sores may occur in the mouth. If you encounter such a situation, if you apply to us, the parts that cause these wounds will be corrected. Applied removable appliances are made of a substance called acryl. Allergy to this substance can develop, although very rarely. In this case, contact your doctor immediately. During the use of the removable appliance, hard foods such as plums, hazelnuts, walnuts, and sticky substances such as gum cause the appliance to break and its structure to deteriorate. It is very important for the course of your treatment to stay away from such foods during your treatment. We think you will help us in this matter and we thank you.
