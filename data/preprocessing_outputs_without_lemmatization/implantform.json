"Informed Consent Form for Extraction Based Fixed Orthodontic Treatment Name Surname: Date of Birth: I was fully informed about the structure of the implants, implant surgery, problems that may be encountered during and after the treatment, and treatment alternatives other than dental implants, and as a result, I allowed dental implants to be surgically placed in my jawbone. I agreed to follow all the rules described by my dentist in the care of implants. Content of Treatment The surgical procedure for placing the implants begins with the removal of the gingival tissues and exposing the jawbone. This is followed by the preparation of implant sockets slightly smaller than the width and length of the roots of your own tooth into the jawbone. Then, metal cylindrical screws implants are placed in these prepared slots. In cases where insufficient bone tissue is present, additional surgical procedures such as placing bone grafts in the surgical area and covering these grafts with a membrane can be performed. All surgical procedures are performed under local anesthesia. If requested by the patient or if the doctor deems it necessary, sedative sedative drugs can be given to the patient before the surgery. For two weeks following the surgery, no removable or fixed prosthesis should be placed in the surgery area without the permission of the dentist. If a two-stage dental implant is placed in the jawbone A second surgical procedure is performed 3 - 8 months after the first surgical procedure. At this stage, the implant is evaluated for proper healing, and a metal piece that protrudes from the gum to the mouth is placed on the implant. If a single-stage dental implant is used, this procedure is not required. In addition, minor surgical correction may be required to correct any soft tissue growth or irregularity around the dental implant. During the prosthetic phase, a metal piece is placed on the implant. According to the treatment planning, a crown or bridge is attached to this metal part or removable prostheses are attached. Alternative Treatments to Implant Application 1. No treatment may be applied to renew your dentures you use or to replace your extracted teeth. However, it is necessary to consider the preservation of the teeth that support the prosthesis or the slow but progressive melting of the jawbone. 2. Without implant application, new fixed or removable prostheses can be made according to the condition of your mouth. 3. Various surgical treatments can be applied to better prepare the ground for your new prosthesis. Problems That May Be Encountered 1. During or after the surgical procedure, the following problems may be encountered, including but not limited to: infection, bleeding, swelling, pain, discoloration bruising at the surgical site or on your face, damage or spasm of the jaw joint, slow healing, usually temporary but very rarely permanent lip , jaw tip and tongue numbness, opening of the sinus or nasal cavity during surgery, bone fractures. 2. During the prosthesis phase, although not limited to this, the following problems may be encountered: the implant does not combine with the jawbone as desired andor the metal parts of the implant are broken. If the implants need to be removed because the implant healing does not occur as desired or a fracture occurs or the prosthesis needs to be changed, the same surgical procedure is applied. No Guarantee of Implant Treatment No guarantee or confidence can be given that the applied implant will be completely successful in terms of function and aesthetics. It is hoped that the implant will heal and remain in the mouth without any problems, but since each case is different and dentistry is not a science whose results are not known beforehand, no promise can be made about its long-term success. Permission for Unforeseen Surgical Conditions The occurrence of unpredictable intraoral conditions during treatment, such as changes in the prognosis of adjacent teeth or insufficient bone support for the implant, may cause the initial treatment plan to be changed. I therefore allow some additional or alternative treatments that may be needed so that the dentist can make the best decision for appropriate treatment. Approval for Daily Care of the Implant In order to increase the chance of success of the implant applied, I was informed about the daily clean care of the implant and adjacent teeth and I agreed to do this care in accordance with the instructions given. I also promised my doctor that I would come for periodic checkups. It is my responsibility to inform my doctor about any problem that occurs after the surgical procedure. I confirm that I have read and understood all of the above, that I have been informed about dental implant treatment and that all my questions have been answered.
