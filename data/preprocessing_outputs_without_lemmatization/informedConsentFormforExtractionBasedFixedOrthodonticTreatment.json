"Informed Consent Form for Extraction Based Fixed Orthodontic Treatment GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ORTHODONTIC TREATMENTS A successful Orthodontic treatment is possible with the patientpatients family being informed about the treatment to be performed. However, every orthodontic treatment has its limitations and potential risks. Please read the following information. You are free to accept or reject orthodontic treatment based on this information. If you have any questions or if there is something you dont understand, please consult your doctor. Orthodontic Treatment is a long-term and discipline-requiring process. A successful outcome requires collaboration between the patient, the doctor, and the family. X-rays of the teeth and head are necessary for diagnostic purposes at the beginning of the treatment, during the treatment, and for control purposes after the treatment. Taking photographs inside and outside the mouth before and during the treatment is also necessary for a clearer monitoring of the treatment. Advanced examinations may be required for the diagnosis and treatment of certain orthodontic anomalies. These records may be used in scientific publications and presentations without revealing your identity or in a way that your identity will not be understood. These records will not be used for purposes other than these, and they will not be shared with others except at the request of legal authorities. The patient must adhere to the treatment prescribed by the doctor until the end and in full. In case of lack of collaboration from the patientfamily leading to a lack of adaptation, and if this situation persists, the doctor has the right to terminate the treatment when it is determined that the patient will not benefit from the treatment. The individual response of the patients tissues to the treatment is an important factor in the outcome of Orthodontic Treatment. Especially in individuals in the developmental age with skeletal anomalies, if the necessary growth support cannot be provided, the targeted structure may not be achieved. In such cases, the doctor may end the treatment to avoid harm to the individual. The presence of any systemic disease related to the general health status of the patient blood diseases, bone diseases, hormonal disorders, allergic diseases, etc. may affect orthodontic treatment. The patient must inform the orthodontist about these and similar diseases before starting orthodontic treatment and report any changes in health statustreatment during the treatment. Depending on the type of treatment applied to correct dental, jaw, and facial disorders within biological limits, it is necessary to come to control appointments at intervals determined by your doctor. Orthodontic treatment is not just about aligning teeth for aesthetic purposes. The main goal is to achieve a healthy oral, dental, and jaw structure that looks good, in addition to providing good chewing function. Orthodontic treatment is applied to healthy teeth. Before starting the treatment, all teeth should be examined by a dentist, decayed teeth should be treated, root canal treatment should be performed if necessary, and tooth brushing training should be given. Treatment is not started for patients who do not brush their teeth enough. Orthodontic treatment begins after the patients oral care improves, and the necessary treatments are done. Orthodontic treatment consists of two consecutive stages: active treatment and retention treatment. Active treatment corrects the dental and jaw disorders, while retention treatment ensures the permanence of the improvement achieved. The treatment fees provided to you cover both stages. The durations of these stages may vary depending on the severity of the disorder in each individual. Even if the treatment is planned and carried out in accordance with all rules, the guarantee of achieving all results cannot be assured. This is because the limits of the selected treatment, disruptions in the patient-doctor-family collaboration, and patient-specific factors such as: genetic structure, growth and development factors that cannot be foreseen during treatment, the response of oral and dental tissues to orthodontic treatment, bad habits such as tooth clenching, teeth grinding, etc. make it impossible to guarantee results. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS DURING FIXED ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT During orthodontic treatment, various treatment stages and materials are used. Brackets are attached to the teeth and wires are threaded through them. Supportive screws placed in the jawbone when necessary jaw-expanding screw devices, metal springs, elastic chains, etc., can also be used. Sometimes, external devices that need to be worn and removed by the patient such as headgearface masks or intraoralextraoral rubber bands may be necessary. Instructions and recommendations from your doctor regarding their use must be followed exactly. Temporary sensitivity in the teeth, small wounds in the gums, lips, cheeks, or tongue may develop during orthodontic treatments. Eating hard foods like nuts, chewing gum, and sticky substances can cause damage to the appliance. Avoiding such foods is crucial for the progress of your treatment. Inform your doctor immediately in such situations and always follow your doctors recommendations. Please read the brochure we provide carefully, as it will assist us in this matter, and we appreciate your cooperation. Failure to brush the teeth adequately during treatment can lead to cavities, inflammation of the gums, gum recession, and loss of supporting bone. Additionally, the consumption of acidic beverages can cause permanent matte white spots, which increase with the use of braces. Therefore, it is essential to brush your teeth regularly after main and intermediate meals. For optimal oral care and healthy teeth and gums, regular dental check-ups are necessary. In some cases, even with good care, gum recession may occur due to very thin supporting bone tissue around the teeth. Variations in the shape, size, and position of the teeth, small or missing teeth, or abnormally positioned teeth may prevent achieving the ideal treatment result e.g., completely closing extraction spaces. Sometimes, gaps may be visible between corrected teeth near the gum line. Supportive treatments such as aesthetic fillings, crown-bridge restorations, or periodontal treatment may be required for these cases. Shortening of the roots of some teeth may occur during orthodontic treatment. Generally, the amount of shortening is minimal and does not have a significant impact. If severe shortening is detected, the doctor may decide to terminate orthodontic treatment. Some patients with sensitive constitutions may experience allergic reactions to materials used in orthodontic treatment. In such a case, you must inform our clinic as soon as possible. In this situation, a change in the treatment plan or discontinuation of treatment may be necessary. Immediately after completing active orthodontic treatment, there is a tendency for teeth to change their positions and return to their initial positions. Therefore, retention treatment should be started right after active orthodontic treatment ends. In this treatment, either a wire is permanently attached to the inside of the teeth or a removable retention device is used. Fixed retention devices remain behind the teeth indefinitely unless otherwise stated by your doctor. It is crucial to use removable retention devices as instructed by the doctor to ensure the permanence of the treatment result. Failure to follow the doctors advice when using removable retention devices inevitably leads to the teeth returning to their previous state. The disruption of teeth and relationships due to incomplete retention treatment may require a new orthodontic treatment. This situation requires additional fees. In the following periods after the completion of orthodontic treatment, the closure of teeth may be negatively affected in various situations. Examples include genetic influences that determine the size of teeth, jaws, and tongue, growth or developmental changes, continued oral habits such as mouth breathing, tongue thrust, finger sucking, and inappropriate pressures exerted by erupted wisdom teeth. These are situations that can develop beyond the control of the orthodontist and may require additional treatments. In cases where there is not enough space for the patients upperlower teeth to be properly aligned, EXTRACTION ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT is applied. Extraction orthodontic treatment involves the extraction of teeth that your doctor deems medically appropriate to resolve the existing problem in the mouth. Therefore, region, a total of teeth tooth extraction is planned. The spaces obtained by tooth extraction will be filled by repositioning teeth that are outside the dental arch if unwanted situations mentioned above do not occur after treatment. The treatment result will be permanent. ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT Date: Name Surname: Date of birth: Gender: Male Female EXPLANATION ORTHODONTIC DIAGNOSIS Based on our clinical and radiological evaluations, the orthodontic problems we detected are listed below. RECOMMENDED TREATMENT The following procedures are required to address these orthodontic problems. TREATMENT PROCESS Our patient the estimated duration of active orthodontic treatment varies from patient to patient, approximately as estimated These durations are valid under the condition that undesired situations mentioned above do not occur and the ideal doctor-patient harmony is achieved as described above. POTENTIAL NEGATIVES DURING ORTHODONTIC TREATMENT Negative situations may arise during orthodontic treatment. a. Orthodontic forces applied to teeth may cause painful tooth sensitivity for about a week. b. Metal, porcelain, or acrylic brackets on teeth may temporarily create difficulties in eating, speaking, and swallowing. c. Ulcers may occur on the lips, cheeks, and tongue. d. Oral hygiene may become challenging. e. Undesirable situations like bracket detachment or wire breakage may occur. f. Frequent bracket detachment can cause damage to both the treatment and the enamel layer of the tooth. g. Erosion resorption may occur at the root tips. h. Damage to the tooth nerve may result in the need for root canal treatment. i. If the supporting bone tissue around the tooth is very thin, gum recession due to bone loss may be observed. Insufficient brushing of teeth during treatment may lead to decay, permanent white spots, and gum inflammation. Gum inflammation over time leads to red color changes, bleeding, and gum enlargement. Therefore, teeth should be brushed regularly after main and snack meals until it is ensured that all food residues are removed. To prevent damage or breakage of fixed braces attached to teeth, it is necessary to adhere to the prohibition list provided by your orthodontist until the end of the treatment.
