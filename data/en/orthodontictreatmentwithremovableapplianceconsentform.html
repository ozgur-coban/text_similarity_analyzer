                Orthodontic Treatment is a long-term and discipline-requiring
                process. A successful outcome requires collaboration between the
                patient, the doctor, and the family.

                X-rays of the teeth and head are necessary for diagnostic
                purposes at the beginning of the treatment, during the
                treatment, and for control purposes after the treatment. Taking
                photographs inside and outside the mouth before and during the
                treatment is also necessary for a clearer monitoring of the
                treatment. Advanced examinations may be required for the
                diagnosis and treatment of certain orthodontic anomalies.

                adaptation, and if this situation persists, the doctor has the
                right to terminate the treatment when it is determined that the
                patient will not benefit from the treatment.

                The individual response of the patient's tissues to the
                treatment is an important factor in the outcome of Orthodontic
                Treatment. Especially in individuals in the developmental age
                with "skeletal anomalies," if the necessary growth support
                cannot be provided, the targeted structure may not be achieved.
                In such cases, the doctor may end the treatment to avoid harm to
                the individual.

                Orthodontic treatment is not just about aligning teeth for
                aesthetic purposes. The main goal is to achieve a healthy oral,
                dental, and jaw structure that looks good, in addition to
                providing good chewing function.

                Orthodontic treatment is applied to healthy teeth. Before
                starting the treatment, all teeth should be examined by a
                dentist, decayed teeth should be treated, root canal treatment
                should be performed if necessary, and tooth brushing training
                should be given. Treatment is not started for patients who do
                not brush their teeth enough. Orthodontic treatment begins after
                the patient's oral care improves, and the necessary treatments
                are done.

                Orthodontic treatment consists of two consecutive stages: active
                treatment and retention treatment. Active treatment corrects the
                dental and jaw disorders, while retention treatment ensures the
                permanence of the improvement achieved. The treatment fees
                provided to you cover both stages. The durations of these stages
                may vary depending on the severity of the disorder in each
                individual.

                Even if the treatment is planned and carried out in accordance
                with all rules, the guarantee of achieving all results cannot be
                assured. This is because the limits of the selected treatment,
                disruptions in the patient-doctor-family collaboration, and
                patient-specific factors (such as: genetic structure, growth and
                development factors that cannot be foreseen during treatment,
                the response of oral and dental tissues to orthodontic
                treatment, bad habits such as tooth clenching, teeth grinding,
                etc.) make it impossible to guarantee results.

              >There is a tendency for the teeth to change their position and
              return to their original position at the beginning of the
              treatment immediately after the end of orthodontic treatment. For
              this reason, “reinforcement treatment” should be started as soon
              as the active orthodontic treatment is finished. In this
              treatment, either a fixed wire is attached to the inner side of
              the teeth or a reinforcing device is used that the patient can put
              on and take off. Fixed reinforcement appliances stay behind the
              teeth indefinitely, unless your physician tells you otherwise. The
              use of the removable reinforcing device in accordance with the
              physician'sinstructions is very important for the permanence of
              the treatment result. It is inevitable for the teeth to return to
              their former state as a result of using the removable retaining
              appliances without following the physician'sadvice. This requires
              recharging.</span
